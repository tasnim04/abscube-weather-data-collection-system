# weather-data-collection-system

The primary objective of this project was to create a weather data collection system, with several important parameters controlled by a micro-controller. The micro-controller selected for this task is the Raspberry Pi 4 board computer. Its input-output (GPIO) pins were utilised to connect the sensors into the system, and store data locally. 

Version 1 of this data collection system includes the following sensors:
•	DHT22 sensor – measure temperature and humidity 
•	DS18B20 waterproof sensor - measure water temperature
•	Analog UV sensor – measure UV light intensity
•	BMP180 sensor - measure barometric pressure and tenperature
