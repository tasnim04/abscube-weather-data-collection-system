# weather-data-collection-system

The primary objective of this project was to create a weather data collection system, with several important parameters controlled by a micro-controller. The micro-controller selected for this task is the Raspberry Pi 4 board computer. Its input-output (GPIO) pins were utilised to connect the sensors into the system, and store data locally. 

Version 1 of this data collection system includes the following sensors:

•	DHT22 sensor – measure temperature and humidity 

•	DS18B20 waterproof sensor - measure water temperature

•	GUVA-S12SD Analog UV light sensor – measure UV light intensity

•	BMP180 sensor - measure barometric pressure and tenperature

Additionally, an Analog-to-Digital Converter, MCP3008 was used to convert the analog data generated by the GUVA-S12SD Analog UV light sensor to into digital output.
